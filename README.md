# matrix
A matrix algebra class in python.

When I learnt about matrices in school, as my teacher gave us a humongous amount of matrix multiplication and determinant questions as homework. So I made this to do my homework for me.


Dec 2021 update: Looking back, from a software design and code writing POV not something to be proud of. I now consider efficient, modular, clean, and easy to read code as my tenets when it comes to writing software. But still keeping this up as I had fun with this at the time.
